Learn how to create a dynamic nested API route

routes and now that we know how to create a simple nested API routes let's

try to create a um Dynamic API routes okay so that will be something something

like this only it is nested okay so just a quick note on this one um here in kn.

viw or in KNX website it says here that note that current currently server routes does not support full does not

support the full functionality of the dynamic routes as Pages do okay but

during the test it actually works but I wouldn't suggest um using this in the in

your um real world uh projects okay and I'm sure in the future they will support a Dynamic API routes okay so let's

actually test that so here um in the um API so in the API folder let's create a

new folder so um let's say for example we have a products so that will be uh

products and then inside the uh products folder let's create a new file and that

will be um a dynamic category okay so category and Then followed by

a um HTTP method so get. DS okay so

export default Define event handler and then event okay just like that and then

let's just simply return here um product category okay and then let's uh see that

in action so here um remove that uh let's actually remove

until the API okay so products and then the dynamic um category name okay so

product category okay and then um to create a nested uh Dynamic routes let's

um create a new folder and that will be um category okay so

Cate gory okay just like that so similar to this one the only difference is um

this is a file and this is a folder okay so inside a category or inside a dynamic

category folder let's create a new file and that will be a um product ID and Then followed by a

um a method so which is get. DS okay so

export default Define event handler and then

event okay and then um product ID okay

okay so um let's actually um test that so here um since since this is our um

product category as you can see if I send that this is our um product category but if I'm going to add um

another slash or forward slash there so that will trigger the um product ID here

which is also a dynamic so for example one 123 that will output the product ID

which is this one here um to actually see that in action if it's actually

working so let's um return get um request

request params I think um params a router params okay and then

event and then save that and then in the postman let's send that and it will

output the um category here so which is this one and then the product ID which

is this one here okay and if we go to the um just the category here so it it will

output the product category so if you're going to try to um output the params so

example here it should output only the um category params okay so let's go back

to the um product ID so uh 1 2 3 4 okay

and then sample category name so category it's um category value okay

so category and then category value and then product ID that's the 1 2 3 4 okay

so the category here that will be um that's the um category folder here or

and then the category uh file and then the product ID that will be the uh Dynamic product ID here okay so that

will work the same with uh post and get okay so let's actually test that so if

I'm going to uh change that to

post okay and then change that to

post and then that will work the same okay so same thing for the others as well so put patch and delete okay so I

hope that makes sense and um let me know if you have any suggestions or questions about this one since it I think KNX um

this is not verified by KNX okay but I think I'm sure they will do that in the future
